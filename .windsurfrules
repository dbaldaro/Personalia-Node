Use TypeScript

    Provides strong typing and improves developer experience.
    Helps avoid runtime errors through static type checking.
    Simplifies integration into TypeScript-based projects.

HTTP Client

    Use a robust HTTP client like axios or the native fetch API.
    Centralize the HTTP client logic (httpClient.ts) for easier maintenance.

Error Handling

    Create a custom error handling class to provide consistent error messages.
    Map API errors to custom error objects with relevant status codes and messages.

Modular Design

    Split API endpoints into separate modules (e.g., auth, users, assets).
    Avoid a monolithic structure for easier maintenance and scalability.

Code Comments & JSDoc

    Provide clear comments for complex code sections.
    Use JSDoc to generate documentation

README.md

Include a well-structured README.md file:
    Library purpose and features.
    Installation instructions.
    Code examples for common use cases.
    Contributing guidelines.

Unit & Integration Tests

    Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha/Chai.
    Write tests for:
        Successful API calls.
        Error handling.
        Edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs).

Test Coverage

    Aim for high code coverage (90%+).
    Use tools like nyc (for Jest) to measure coverage.

Mocking API Requests

    Use libraries like nock to mock API responses during testing.
